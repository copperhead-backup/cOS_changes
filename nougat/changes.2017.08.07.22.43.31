- enable Verizon visual voicemail support
- add CNEService for the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P to bring them in line with the Pixel and Pixel XL
- Pixel, Pixel XL: add CarrierConfig vendor.xml other than the Verizon entries from stock, resolving remaining non-Sprint / non-Verizon carrier compatibility issues (VoLTE / VoWiFi now work where supported, other than on Verizon where it requires proprietary apps / remote admin backdoor)
- fix upstream bug in the permissions review activity (toggles only worked for new permissions, not previously granted / rejected ones)
