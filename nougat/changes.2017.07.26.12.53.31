- rework how the INTERNET permission works (Network permission group will need to be toggled off again as desired)
- make SET_TIME_ZONE require signature|privileged like SET_TIME (it's much less sensitive but shouldn't be a 'normal' permission)
- stop granting location to Chromium by default for fresh installs (it works fine without it and requests it after the user grants access to a site)
- add toggle to Settings -> Security for disabling camera usage from the lockscreen
- Updater (Pixel, Pixel XL): set minimum latency for idle reboot job to 5 minutes
- Settings: remove irrelevant wallpaper copyright information
