These are the changelogs for stable releases of CopperheadOS. The release notes
before the Nougat 2016.12.06.05.21.23 release should be taken with a grain of
salt since we weren't really publishing them yet so it wasn't being done very
carefully.

CopperheadOS started in 2014 based on Android KitKat but we only started
keeping more user friendly changelogs late in the Marshmallow era.

The Nexus 9 maintenance branch is not included. It split off when the other
devices moved to nougat-mr2-release and continued after the other devices moved
to Oreo-based releases. It may be included here in the future but we wanted to
avoid confusion.

Since Pixels, there are separate release channels including the public Stable
and Beta channels. Each Stable release made it through the Beta channel and our
internal Testing channel. The Nexus 5X and 6P moved to the current update
system with release channels with the Oreo-based 2017.09.24.15.

Releases that never made it to the Stable channel are not listed here, since
their list of changes ended up in a future Stable release anyway unless the
changes never shipped.
