Changes since 2017.12.07.19:

- Updater: reduce update check rate to every 4 hours from 1
- Updater: reduce retry rate to every 4 minutes from 1
- DeskClock: fix broken upstream fix in Android 8.1 to match our fix for Android 8.0
- Nexus 5X: update stock update-binary to OPM1.171019.011
- stop disabling brotli compression for legacy format over-the-air updates
- replace global toggle for background clipboard access with a per-app toggle (still disabled by default)
- add toggle for background audio recording (now disabled by default)

Notes:

Apps can still start recording audio in the foreground and continue in the
background even with background audio recording disabled. This will end up
being mitigated in the future but it isn't fully implemented yet.
