Changes since 2018.02.18.00:

- Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL: drop unused google_camera_app SELinux domain: Google Camera isn't available in a useful way so exposing the Hexagon DSP tech stack as attack surface via Google Camera is unnecessary. HDR+ is provided via the Pixel Visual Core to compatible apps already on the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL.
