Changes since 2017.12.10.21:

- set the default for the background audio recording toggle to allowed for the time being

Notes:

- Blocking background audio recording by default ended up hitting far more app
  compatibility issues than expected. The goal is still to disable it by
  default but we need to whitelist Phone services and figure out if anything can
  be done to improve compatibility with apps like Signal and WhatsApp.
