- use Cloudflare DNS as the default fallback: Cloudflare DNS has a better privacy policy than Google Public DNS and has DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS so it won't be a downgrade when Android ships one of them.
- tethering: use Cloudflare DNS servers as defaults
- NetworkDiagnostics: switch to Cloudflare DNS
- SettingsLib: use Cloudflare DNS servers as hints
- Settings: expose audio recording user restriction
